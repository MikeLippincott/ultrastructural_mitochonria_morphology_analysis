## About the Data
The data are EM images of NIH3T3 cells treated with control short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and shRNA targeting OPA1.
These data are from the paper: [Suga et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002246).
The data are both raw Z-stacks and segmented mitochondria.
The segmented mitochondria are in the form of a 3D mask.
It should be noted that these data are annotated with the ground truth mitochondria, lamellar mitochondrial cristae, and tubular mitochondrial cristae.
These ground truth masks are included in the data as `.tiff` files as well as the raw data as `.tiff` files.


## Future Data Release
In the future, we plan to release the data on a public repository, or a similar platform.
Please check back for updates on the data release.
In the past we have used `zendodo`,`figshare`, and `IDR` for data releases.
